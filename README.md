# Web-Dev-Final
Final project for CSCI 3230U

Our goal was to make a website which allowed users to sign in using their UOIT student numbers
and a password, which would then direct them to a page containing links to all of their classes,
stored in a Mongo database. Clicking one of these buttons would then go to a new page containing
an HTML table featuring a grade breakdown, allowing users to enter teh component name (Assignment 01, etc.)
, the amount of their grade it is worth, and their grade on it. They could then click the 'Calculate'
button to save the data to the databse, as well as show their current grade at the bottom of the page.
The idea was that students could set this up at the begeinning of the semester and add to it as they
get new grades back, allowing them to see their grade rise as the semester goes on.

We have included two file structures in the submission. The first one, titled 'Done' is our proof of concept,
featuring HTML pages for all the desired features, as well as css and working javascript, with features
including AJAX, jQuery, BootStrap and more. Featuring a working grade calculator on 'class.html'.

To use this site, open 'login.html' and sign in using 100523538 as both the username and password. 

Also included is 'Good' which features the work we completed using additional features like Node.js
and MongoDB, but based on the folder name, it was not completed in time to be fully functional.
I attempted to change this folder name to 'Not Done' but it continued to give me errors, I apologize for any confusion.
